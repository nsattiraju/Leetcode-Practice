# Leetcode-Practice

🧠 A growing collection of my Leetcode solutions, categorized by topic and difficulty.

This repository is part of my ongoing interview preparation and problem-solving journey. Each solution includes clean code, intuitive logic, and sometimes brief explanations or edge case considerations.

### 🗂 Topics Covered
- Arrays & Strings
- Hashing & Maps
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Binary Search
- Trees & Graphs
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Stacks & Queues
- Greedy Algorithms

### 📌 Goals
- Sharpen problem-solving skills with daily practice
- Build pattern recognition across problem types
- Revisit problems regularly to solidify understanding
- Maintain a personal reference of clean, well-commented code

### 💡 Approach
Each problem is solved in Java (sometimes with a Python version later), with a focus on:
- Readable and maintainable code
- Identifying brute-force vs optimized approaches
- Writing reusable helper methods where needed
- Clean folder structure and file naming for quick access
